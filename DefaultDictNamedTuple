Created on Thu Nov 22 09:17:51 2018

Steps:

    1. Read in data DATA.csv

    2. setup named tuple for columns and for output.

    3. add all rows of csv into defaultdic with the date as the key for each tuple.

    4. Output List of tuples with a unique key of the date.

   5. demo of how these collections work.
